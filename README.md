# EE6222 - Machine Vision

### Learning Objective:

This course aims to introduce to students the basic concepts of vision based auomation systems in industrial and practical settings. Development of vision based automation system may invovle image capture and analysis, three dimensional data processing and machine intelligence. Hence, this course covers these topics appropriately.

### Content:

Fundamentals of image processing & analysis. Feature Extraction Techniques. Pattern / Object Recognition and Interpretation. Three Dimensional Computer Vision. Three-Dimensional Recognition Techniques. Biometrics.

### Learning Outcome:

- Understand the basic concepts of image pre-processing & analysis, feature extraction and pattern classification.
- Understand the basic concepts of three dimensional image analysis and recognition.
- Apply the machine vision concepts to develop simple automation systems.
